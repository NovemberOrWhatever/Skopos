  title = Indian Ocean Telecommunications - Level 2
  description = <b>Program: Second Generation Telecommunications Satellites (Skopos Beta)<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>The first generation telecommunications satellite network has proven successful. However, demand is growing for satellite communication, and more countries want dedicated satellite links. Provide simultaneous links between Europe, Pakistan, Thailand, and Australia
  notes = Additional Earth stations have been constructed in Fucino (Italy), Si Racha (Thailand), and Deh Mando (Pakistan).
