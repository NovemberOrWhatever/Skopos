  title = Pacific Telecommunications - Level 2
  description = <b>Program: Second Generation Telecommunications Satellites (Skopos Beta)<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>The first generation telecommunications satellite network has proven successful. However, demand is growing for satellite communication, and more countries want dedicated satellite links. Provide simultaneous links between North America, Japan, and Australia.
  notes = An additional Earth station has been constructed in Paumalu (Hawaii). Your satellite network will need the capacity to support 2 links at the same time, plus the previous level 1 services. Whether you achieve this with a MEO or LEO constellation or a single GEO satellite is up to you.
  synopsis = Provide transpacific multi-access two-way telecom for 90 days with 95% availability (~23 h per day).
  completedMessage = Regular telecasts are now possible between Japan, Australia and North America.
