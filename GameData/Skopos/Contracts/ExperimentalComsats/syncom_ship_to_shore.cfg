  description = <b>Program: Experimental Telecommunications Satellites (Skopos Beta)<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Satellite communications offers the ability to communicate with nearly any point on Earth, including the oceans. A ship equipped with a satellite terminal could be provided a reliable radio link to shore in nearly any condition, bypassing many of the difficulties involved in communicating with a vessel at sea. However, this will require a satellite terminal small enough to fit on a ship.
  synopsis = Provide ship-to-shore communications for three months with 50% availability (~12 hours per day).
  notes = The USNS Kingsport has been fitted with a satellite Earth station, and is stationed in the Gulf of Guinea. The Kingsport also has a VHF command and telemetry antenna that, if provided with a link to shore by communication satellite, will be able to relay data from scientific satellites.

  completedMessage = The experiment has successfully demonstrated the viability of a ship-to-shore link via satellite, paving the way for a commercial operating system.
