  description = <b>Program: Experimental Telecommunications Satellites (Skopos Beta)<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>For a transpacific satellite telecom system to be viable, it must provide a sustained link, not just a few minutes until the satellite passes below the horizon. Provide a transpacific connection that supports a few voice channels for at least 12 hours a day. The lower required data rate should allow a very small satellite to be used, opening up the possibility for higher orbits.
  synopsis = Provide transpacific telephony for three months with 50% availability (~12 hours per day).
  notes = Earth stations with cutting-edge antennas have been built in the Kashima prefecture (Japan) and at Point Mugu (California). It should be possible to establish a transpacific link with a very small satellite.

  completedMessage = The experiment has successfully demonstrated the viability of a Transpacific link via satellite, paving the way for a commercial operating system.
