  description = <b>Program: First Generation Telecommunications Satellites (Skopos Beta)<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>We would like to create "Earth stations at sea", ships equipped with unified S-band antennas to relay data from crewed and uncrewed scientific spacecraft. However, a ship at sea cannot have a landline connection to mission control, and existing HF radio systems are unreliable and low quality. Instead, these ships have had a satellite communications terminal installed, allowing them to relay data back to mission control via communications satellites.
  notes = The tracking ships USNS Vanguard, Redstone, and Mercury have been positioned in the Atlantic and Pacific near the equator. If they are provided with a link to shore, they will be able to use their unified S-band systems to function as an Earth station. Whether you achieve this with a MEO or LEO constellation or a single GEO satellite is up to you.
  synopsis = Provide ship-to-shore communications for 90 days with 95% availability (~23 h per day).
  completedMessage = Telemetry can now be relayed from tracking ships to mission control.

  rewardReputation = 200    //Kinda hard. Ship terminals are weaker, and ships are positioned in the Atlantic and Pacific, but it should be possible to piggyback off existing infrastructure.
