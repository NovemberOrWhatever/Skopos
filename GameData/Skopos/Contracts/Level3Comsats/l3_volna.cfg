  title = Soviet Maritime Satellite Communications - Level 3
  //mostly from The MARISAT System [12]
  description = <b>Program: Third Generation Telecommunications Satellites (Skopos Beta)<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Soviet vessels on the high seas currently must undergo long periods of isolation from communications with fleet headquarters. Shore-based HF band is limited and unreliable, and in many areas Soviet shipping must rely on international communication networks, which the Soviet government considers an unacceptable security risk. With the power of satellite communications, we would like to provide reliable telephone and teletype service to the high seas.
  notes = New satellite Earth stations have been constructed at Odessa (Ukrainian SSR) and Nakhodka (Primorsky Krai) to serve as command centers for ships at sea. Ships across the Eastern Hemisphere have been provided with compact, low-power satellite terminals to communicate with our satellite network. These terminals are much less capable than previous ground-based satellite Earth stations, and will require a more powerful satellite to establish a reliable link.
  synopsis = Provide ship-to-shore communications for one month with 95% availability (~23 h per day).
  completedMessage = Ships across the Eastern Hemisphere can now call home at any time with a satellite terminal as small as a file cabinet.

  rewardReputation = 325    //Kinda hard. Ship terminals are weaker, southern hemisphere ships out of range of Soviet-focused satellites
