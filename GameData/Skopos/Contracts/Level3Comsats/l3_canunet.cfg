As the first stage of this system, satellite links should be established across the populated areas in the southern portion of Canada. This nearly 5000 kilometer (3000 mile) strip of land along the US-Canada border contains the majority of the Canadian population, and a satellite telecommunications should allow TV and voice circuits to be quickly routed from one side of the country to the other.
